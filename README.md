## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/  
Stack Overflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  One challenge with this submission was getting all of the images to display properly and be formatted in the way I wanted. There were multiple problems with how I was displaying images on the buttons/custom text such as the image repeating itself, not scaling properly, not reflecting the changes I made in the code, and overall not being formatted how I wanted. I also was unsure of the options available to me in terms of styling (what I can and cannot do) which made solving these issues even more challenging. 

  Overcoming my issues with images took a lot of trial and error before I was happy with the result. I constantly was making changes to values such as width/height and checking how it changed the look of the page. I did this for one element and then moved onto the rest once I was satisfied. This allowed me to replicate my solution to the problem efficiently rather than change the same properties for every element over and over. I also looked at outside resources such as w3Schools to see all of the options I had for styling images to get it to look how I wanted. I constantly referred to css commands and syntax to find exactly what I wanted and how to code it. For a few specific issues, such as the images repeating, I did have to look up how to solve them on Stack Overflow. Overall, overcoming this challenge required me to divide and conquer the problems I was facing, as well as seek relevant resources and apply the knowledge I gain while navigating through each issue.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 
 A question I have about web development is how do I create more advanced and reactive websites? I constantly see very interactive websites with so many features both visually and functionally every day. I currently do not have the fully developed skillset to code such complex functionality and features that are implemented in html,css,and javascript. I would like to know how these projects are structured and the techniques used in web development to achieve such results.
 
 Another question I have about web development is how do I manage and maintain websites? I am only accustomed to writing local software, which is not open to anyone at any time, and does not contain sensitive data. Therefore, I am not familiar with the techniques used to secure websites and debug code that is used on a variety of devices. I am also not experienced in maintaining software over time, so I wonder how web developers review, refactor, and improve their code over time.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  If I had more time to work on this project, I would try to add more features such as time constraints, more variety in the sounds I use, a high-score tracker, and options for the player to choose. I would like to build on this idea for a simple game and really make it my own, with features I think are important and fun to have. I think it would allow me to create a more interesting/replayable game and develop my skills in web development.
  
  If I had more time, I would also clean up my code and get rid of unnecessary parts. As I become a more experienced programmer, I have been lately striving to make my code more readable by including more comments, making abstractions/subroutines when I can, and using descriptive names for variables/functions. Therefore, with more time and effort, I could clean up my website's code and organize it to make it more future-proof.
